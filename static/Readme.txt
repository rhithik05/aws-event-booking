## üìã Deployment Steps

### 1. Launch EC2 Instance
   - Configure security groups for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic.
   - Transfer Flask application to the EC2 instance.

### 2. Deploy Flask App
   - Install dependencies and start the app on the EC2 instance.
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   sudo yum install python3 -y
   sudo pip3 install flask boto3 mysql-connector-python
   python3 app.py
   ```

### 3. Test the Application
   - Access via the EC2 public IP address.
